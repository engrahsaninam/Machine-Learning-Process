# Advanced Housing Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for an advanced housing price prediction project. The primary goal of this project is to develop accurate models for predicting housing prices based on various features related to property characteristics, location, and amenities.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Wrangling**: Initial processing of the dataset, including handling missing values, addressing duplicates, and preparing the data for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Comprehensive exploration of the dataset using advanced visualizations, including pair plots, violin plots, joint plots, cluster maps, and interactive geospatial visualizations.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Advanced feature engineering techniques, such as one-hot encoding, interaction terms, and polynomial features, to enhance the dataset for modeling.

4. **Modeling**: Development of predictive models using advanced regression techniques, including Lasso Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation and Enhancement**: Evaluation of models on unseen data, assessment of generalization capabilities, and fine-tuning of hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance. Regularization techniques are explored to mitigate overfitting.

## Results

The project achieves the following outcomes:

- **Data Quality**: The dataset is processed, ensuring high data quality for reliable predictions.
  
- **Insightful Visualizations**: Utilization of advanced visualizations provides valuable insights into housing price trends, geographical distribution, and feature impact.

- **Feature Engineering**: Implementation of advanced feature engineering techniques enhances the dataset, contributing to better model performance.

- **Model Accuracy**: The predictive models, including Lasso Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor, demonstrate high accuracy in forecasting housing prices.

- **Robustness**: The models exhibit robustness against outliers and changing market trends.
